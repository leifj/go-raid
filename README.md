# go-RAiD

A cleanroom implementation of the RAiD (Research Activity Identifier) service in Go, based on the [RAiD OpenAPI specification](https://github.com/au-research/raid-au/blob/main/api-svc/idl-raid-v2/src/raido-openapi-3.0.yaml).

## About RAiD

RAiD (Research Activity Identifier) is a persistent identifier system for research projects and activities. It provides:

- **Persistent Identifiers**: Mint unique, persistent identifiers for research activities
- **Rich Metadata**: Track comprehensive metadata including contributors, organizations, dates, subjects, and related resources
- **Access Control**: Manage access levels (open, embargoed, closed)
- **Versioning**: Full version history and change tracking
- **Service Points**: Multi-tenant support for different organizations

## Project Goals

This is a cleanroom implementation that:

- âœ… Implements the full RAiD OpenAPI 3.0 specification
- âœ… Provides a cloud-agnostic solution (no AWS lock-in)
- âœ… Uses standard Go practices and modern libraries
- âœ… Focuses on simplicity and maintainability
- âœ… Supports PostgreSQL for data persistence
- ðŸ”„ Authentication via JWT (future: OAuth2/OIDC)
- ðŸ”„ Full API compatibility with the reference implementation

## Architecture

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or higher
- Optional: PostgreSQL 14+ or CockroachDB (for production storage backends)
- Optional: FoundationDB (for FDB storage backend)

### Quick Start with Makefile

This project includes a comprehensive Makefile for easy building and testing. See [`docs/MAKEFILE_GUIDE.md`](docs/MAKEFILE_GUIDE.md) for full documentation.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/leifj/go-raid.git
cd go-raid

# Show all available commands
make help

# Install dependencies (minimal - file storage only)
make deps

# Build the application
make build

# Run tests
make test

# Run in development mode (file-git storage)
make run-dev
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8080`

### Manual Installation

If you prefer not to use the Makefile:

```bash
# Install dependencies
go mod download

# Build minimal binary (file storage only)
go build -tags noexternal -o bin/raid-server .

# Or build with all storage backends
go build -o bin/raid-server .

# Run the server
./bin/raid-server
```

### Configuration

Configure via environment variables:

```bash
# Server configuration
export SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0
export SERVER_PORT=8080

# Database configuration
export DB_HOST=localhost
export DB_PORT=5432
export DB_NAME=raid
export DB_USER=raid
export DB_PASSWORD=secret
export DB_SSLMODE=disable

# Authentication (optional, for future use)
export AUTH_ENABLED=false
export JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
```

## API Endpoints

- `GET /raid/all-public` - List all public RAiDs
- `GET /raid/{prefix}/{suffix}` - Get a specific RAiD
- `PUT /raid/{prefix}/{suffix}` - Update a RAiD
- `PATCH /raid/{prefix}/{suffix}` - Partially update a RAiD
- `GET /raid/{prefix}/{suffix}/history` - Get RAiD change history

# Run linter (if installed)
golangci-lint run
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! This is a cleanroom implementation, so:

1. All code must be written independently based on the OpenAPI spec
2. Follow Go best practices and idioms
3. Add tests for new functionality
4. Update documentation as needed

See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed contribution guidelines.
